The robot follows lines at high speeds using PID control with real-time tunable parameters via Bluetooth, ensuring optimal performance.

Key Features
1. ESP32 Microcontroller (38-pin variant)
The ESP32 microcontroller is the brain of the robot, offering powerful computation, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities, and ease of use for embedded systems. This allows for seamless motor control, sensor reading, and PID computation to ensure precise line-following behavior.
PID Control: Implements the PID algorithm for fine-tuning the robot’s motion and keeping it aligned with the line.
Bluetooth Communication: Allows real-time tuning of motor parameters and PID constants through a Bluetooth terminal on your phone or a Bluetooth-equipped computer.

2. TB6612FNG Motor Driver
The TB6612FNG is a highly efficient dual H-Bridge motor driver IC, perfect for controlling the N20 DC motors. It provides robust motor control with low power consumption, making it ideal for battery-powered projects like this line-following robot.

Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver: The TB6612FNG can control two motors independently, allowing bidirectional control for both motors with smooth speed and direction regulation.

Low Power Consumption: The TB6612FNG is designed to be efficient, reducing heat generation and extending battery life.
Integrated Thermal Shutdown: This ensures the motor driver doesn’t overheat, providing reliability and protection to the system.

Current Protection: Overcurrent protection features ensure the motor driver and motors are not damaged by excessive current draw, enhancing system stability.
PWM Control: The motor driver uses PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals for precise speed control, enabling the robot to follow the line smoothly and with high responsiveness.

3. Buck Converter
The buck converter ensures efficient power management by stepping down the voltage from a higher voltage source (e.g., 12V) to the required 5V for both the ESP32 and the TB6612FNG motor driver. This helps keep the system powered while reducing power loss during voltage conversion.

Efficient Power Conversion: The buck converter ensures minimal energy loss, increasing the overall efficiency of the robot.
Stable Voltage Supply: With a buck converter, the robot’s electronics receive a consistent voltage, preventing performance drops due to fluctuating power supply.
5. QTR Sensors (Line Detection)
The robot is equipped with 10 QTR sensors, which are used to detect the line's position. These sensors are designed for fast and accurate analog reading, enabling the robot to follow the line with high precision, even during sharp turns.

High Sensitivity: The QTR sensors are highly sensitive to the line's contrast, ensuring precise line detection even under varying light conditions.
Wide Sensor Array: A 10-sensor array ensures a broad field of view for the robot, allowing it to make quick adjustments when the line veers off-center.
5. N20 Motors (3000 RPM)
The robot is powered by N20 DC motors, which offer a high speed of 3000 RPM, providing the necessary agility and responsiveness for the robot to quickly follow a line and handle sharp turns.

High-Speed Motor: The N20 motors are fast and compact, delivering a quick response to sensor input and making the robot nimble on any track.
Efficient Power Consumption: These motors offer a good balance between speed and power efficiency, making them perfect for a battery-powered robot.
6. PID Control for Line Following
The robot’s line-following behavior is governed by the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithm. This continuous feedback loop adjusts the motor speeds to correct the robot’s position, ensuring it stays on the line.

Proportional (P): Corrects the robot’s position based on how far it is from the line. The larger the error, the more significant the correction.
Integral (I): Compensates for small, cumulative errors that may build up over time, helping the robot make finer adjustments.
Derivative (D): Predicts the future behavior of the error by analyzing its rate of change, preventing overshooting and improving stability.
By fine-tuning the Kp, Ki, and Kd parameters, you can adapt the robot’s response to different track conditions, achieving optimal performance.

7. Bluetooth Tuning for Real-Time Adjustments
One of the standout features of this project is the ability to dynamically adjust the robot’s parameters through Bluetooth communication. With the help of a Bluetooth terminal app (such as the Serial Bluetooth Terminal app), you can remotely adjust the robot’s PID constants and motor speeds, fine-tuning its behavior on the fly.

Real-time PID Tuning: You can change the Proportional (Kp), Integral (Ki), and Derivative (Kd) values in real-time, which directly affects how the robot responds to the line. For example, increasing the Kp value will make the robot more responsive to line deviations, while increasing the Kd value helps prevent overshooting by smoothing out the response.
Adjust Motor Speeds: You can control the Base Speed (bsr, bsl) and Maximum Speed (msr, msl) of the right and left motors via Bluetooth commands. This is especially useful for optimizing the robot's speed for different track layouts, ensuring that it can go as fast as possible without losing line tracking accuracy.
Instant Feedback: After adjusting the parameters, you can see the changes in real-time as the robot adjusts its behavior. This provides instant feedback to help you find the optimal PID settings for your specific environment.
Wireless Control: Bluetooth enables the user to tune and control the robot without being physically near it, making testing and adjustments more convenient during practice or race scenarios.
The Bluetooth interface makes the robot more versatile, as it can be adapted to various tracks and line-following conditions without needing to re-upload code or physically adjust components.

8. Calibrated QTR Sensors
The QTR sensors are calibrated during initialization to ensure optimal line-following performance. Calibration helps adapt the sensors to different light conditions and ensures reliable and accurate readings.

Automatic Calibration: Ensures that the sensors are accurately calibrated for the environment before the robot starts following the line.
Adaptability: The sensors are designed to work in various lighting conditions, preventing errors caused by external factors like ambient light or shadows.
